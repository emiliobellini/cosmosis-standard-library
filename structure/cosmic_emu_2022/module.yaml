explanation: |
    "
    CosmicEmu is an emulator designed to interpolate among a collection
    of numerical N-body simulations called Mira-Titan.

    It uses a Gaussian Process interpolation between a set of simulations
    arranged in a lattice in parameter space.

    Each simulation yields a non-linear matter power spectrum P(k,z), and
    the interpolation is between these spectra, so the output should be a
    reasonable (1% accuracy) value of P(k,z) for the given parameters.

    The simulations and the whole process are explained in detail in the paper
    above.

    This version uses the updated 2022 version of the library.
