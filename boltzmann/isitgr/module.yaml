assumptions:
-   The modified gravity phenomenological model described in the referenced papers

explanation: |
    ISiTGR, the Integrated Software in Testing General Relativity, is
    a set of modifications to CAMB and CosmoMC which implement a set of modified
    gravity models where the perturbed metric quantities phi and psi are
    modified by some fitting functions as a general, phenomenological model
    of some unknown new physics.

    There are a number of possible ways to describe such functions; this 
    code uses the variables in equations 8 and 10 of http://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.4583v3.pdf
    and the functional form ansatz in equation 11:

    For X as Q, D, or R we use:
    :math:`X(k,a) = [X_0 \exp{-k/k_c} + X_inf (1-\exp{-k/k_c}) - 1] a^s + 1`

    Most of the parameters in this code are the same as those in camb; see
    the camb module information for more details.

    ISiTGR is pronounced "Is it GR?" not "Easy, Tiger".

    Anthony Lewis has kindly given permission for CAMB to be packaged
    with CosmoSIS.

    The CosmoSIS team packaged this module into cosmosis form so any issues
    running it here please ask us first.
