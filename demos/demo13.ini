; The snake sampler, from Mikkelsen et al
;http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.3126.pdf

;Snake offers all the advantages of grid sampling
;with much better scaling with number of parameters

;You can also stop a snake sampler part way through and
;it's still useful

sampler = snake
verbosity = quiet

[snake]
; Snake tries to explore at most 5 log-like points away from the peak
threshold = 5.0
;But in this case it's first stopped by this criterion
;on the max number of snake iterations (which yields about 10000
;samples in this particular case if MPI is not used)
maxiter = 10000
;This is the same parameter as in grid sampling - the number
;of grid points in each dimension
