assumptions:
-   Pantheon+ statistical and systematic analysis

explanation: >
    Supernova IA can be used as standardisable candles,
    letting us estimate a redshift-distance relation.

    The Pantheon+ sample collected together 1701 light curves of 1550 distinct Type Ia supernovae

    This module uses that data set to constrain the distance modulus
    vs redshift relation.
    
    This version can optionally also include SH0ES HST measurements of H0 from Cepheid variables
    over 40 years of data.

params:
    include_shoes:
        meaning: Whether to include SH0ES H0 measurements. Note that the parameter name has an o not a zero.
