assumptions:
    - HSC measurements of cosmic shear power spectra

explanation: |
    Dalal et al presented measuremets of the cosmic shear E-mode power spectrum
    made using three years of data from the  Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey.
    This module implements the likelihood of that data, using the sacc format.
    This module is a subclass of the sacc_like likelihood in likelihood/sacc_like.
    See the documentation for that module for more details.

    Note that the analysis presented in Dalal et al used 
    the power spectrum from the linear BACCO emulator and pyhmcode2016, the
    interfaces for which are not public immediately. They will be released soon.

params:
    data_file:
        meaning: Filename of the sacc file to use.
        type: str
        default:
    data_sets:
        meaning: Space-separated list of which data sets from within
            the file to use for likelihoods.
        type: str
        default: all
    keep_tracers:
        meaning: Regular expression to select tracers to use.
        type: str
        default: ""
    angle_range_{dataset}_{i}_{j}:
        meaning: Pair of real numbers. If set, for the given data set and pair of
            bins, cut down the data used to this angular range  (min and max)
        type: str
        default:
    cut_{dataset}:
        meaning: Space-separated list of i,j pairs. (no spaces within the pair, just
            betwen them, e.g. cut_lss = 1,2  1,1  3,4.  Remove this bin from the likelihood.
        type: str
        default:
    "{name}_section":
        meaning: For each {name} in the data types used from the file, a cosmosis block section
            to look for the theory predictions in.
        type: str
        default: Various depending on name.
    save_theory:
        meaning: If set, save the theory predictions used in the likelihood to this sacc file.
        type: str
        default:
    save_realization:
        meaning: If set, save a simulated data set to this sacc file.
        type: str
        default:
    covariance_realizations:
        meaning: If >0, assume that the Covariance matrix was estimated from a set
            of MC simulations and should thus have the Anderson-Hartlap factor applied
            to increase its size. If zero, assume infinite number of realizations.
        type: int
        default: -1
    sellentin:
        meaning: If set, use the Sellentin-Heavens 2016 change to the likelihood to
            account for this distribution of the covariance estimates. This changes
            the likelihood to a student's-t form. Note that this invalidates the simulated
            data sets used for the ABC sampler.
        type: bool
        default: false
    like_name:
        meaning: The name of the likelihood to save.
        type: str
        default: 2pt
    likelihood_only:
        meaning: Skip saving the covariance, inverse, simulation, etc. Saves some time.
        type: bool
        default: false
    kind:
        meaning: The interpolation to do into the theory splines.
            See scipy.interpolate.interp1d.
        type: str
        default: cubic

inputs:
    shear_cl:
        ell:
            meaning: If a Fourier-space measurement is used, the angular wave-number
                of the predicted theory curves.  The name of the section here depends on the data type used from
                the file. It might be galaxy_cl or shear_cl, for example.
            type: real 1d
            default:
        bin_{i}_{j}:
            meaning: For various i,j depending what is found in the file, the theory
                predictions for this value. For example, C_ell.
            type: real 1d
            default:
