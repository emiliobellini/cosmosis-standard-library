# TLogsRootsAndNorms

This directory contains pre-computed tables for the COSEBIs filter functions $T_{\pm 
n}(\theta)$ defined for a given angular range (see equation 7 of [Asgari et al 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15633.pdf)).

For this CosmoSIS edition of the COSEBIs module we include the filter functions for $2'\lt \theta \lt 300'$ 
(the Hybrid DES+KiDS choice of scale) and $0.5' \lt \theta \lt 300'$ (the KiDS-1000 choice of scale).

If you wish to explore a different angular range, more pre-computed options are provided in 
[the KiDS-1000 KCAP 
repository](https://github.com/KiDS-WL/kcap/tree/master/cosebis/TLogsRootsAndNorms).
