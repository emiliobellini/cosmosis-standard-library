# WnLog

This directory contains pre-computed tables for the COSEBIs window functions $W_{ 
n}(\ell)$ defined for a given angular range (see equation 9 of [Asgari et al 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15633.pdf).

For this CosmoSIS edition of the COSEBIs module we include the window functions for $2'\lt \theta \lt 300'$ 
(the Hybrid DES+KiDS choice of scale).  If want window functions and other range, the code will calculate 
this for you, but beware it takes a couple of minutes for each node for the first run.   Once you've calculated the table,
you never need calculate it again.
