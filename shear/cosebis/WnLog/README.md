# WnLog

This directory contains pre-computed tables for the COSEBIs window functions $W_{ 
n}(\ell)$ defined for a given angular range (see equation 9 of [Asgari et al 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15633.pdf)).

For this CosmoSIS edition of the COSEBIs module we include the window functions for $2'\lt \theta \lt 300'$ 
(the Hybrid DES+KiDS choice of scale).  If want window functions for any other range, the code will calculate 
this for you.  Beware that this will takes a few of minutes for each node on your the first run.   
Once you've calculated the table, you never need calculate it again.
